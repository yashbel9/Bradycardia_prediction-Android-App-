# Android Application for Bradycardia detection and prediction
In this project, we have developed an android application, that collects the ECG signal from the user and uses the data collected to detect the heart rate from the ECG signal detected. By constantly monitoring the heart rate, we ensure the users health and can possibly prevent various arrhythmia events. In our implementation, we attempt to detect and predict Bradycardia instants in the application.
